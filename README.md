# Movie_Recommendation_System
## Overview
This project aims to build and optimize machine learning models to predict movie ratings based on a dataset of user preferences and movie metadata. It includes data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, evaluation, and prediction generation for submission.
## Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:

- data/movies_metadata.csv: The metadata for movies.
- data/test.csv: The test dataset.
- data/train.csv: The train dataset.
- Movie Recommendation System.ipynb: Jupyter notebook with all the preprocessing, model training, and prediction code.

## Features
- Data Preprocessing: Includes functions for cleaning and preparing the data for modeling.
- Feature Engineering: Techniques to extract and select relevant features from the movie metadata.
- Model Training: Implementation of various machine learning models with scikit-learn.
- Model Evaluation: Code for evaluating models and selecting the best performer based on RMSE (Root Mean Square Error).
- Prediction Generation: Generates predictions for submission.

## How to Use
Setup Environment:

1. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed.\
2. Install required packages by running\
```!pip install``` command \
in your Jupyter which includes pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, nltk, scipy.
